## Remarks on evaluation

- The ultimate goal of a data analysis is to make predictions on new data.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)

# define the outcome and predictors
y <- heights$sex
x <- heights$height

# generate training and test sets
set.seed(2007)
test_index <- createDataPartition(y, times = 1, p = 0.5, list = FALSE)
test_set <- heights[test_index, ]
train_set <- heights[-test_index, ]

# guess the outcome
y_hat <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), length(test_index), replace = TRUE) %>% 
  factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))

# compute accuracy
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)

# compare heights in males and females in our data set
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(mean(height), sd(height))

# now try predicting "male" if the height is within 2 SD of the average male
y_hat <- ifelse(x > 62, "Male", "Female") %>% factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
mean(y == y_hat)

# examine the accuracy of 10 cutoffs
cutoff <- seq(61, 70)
accuracy <- map_dbl(cutoff, function(x){
  y_hat <- ifelse(train_set$height > x, "Male", "Female") %>% 
    factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
  mean(y_hat == train_set$sex)
})
data.frame(cutoff, accuracy) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cutoff, accuracy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() 
max(accuracy)

best_cutoff <- cutoff[which.max(accuracy)]
best_cutoff

y_hat <- ifelse(test_set$height > best_cutoff, "Male", "Female") %>% 
  factor(levels = levels(test_set$sex))
y_hat <- factor(y_hat)
mean(y_hat == test_set$sex)

```
Some notes about the code above:
- the set.seed() function is used to obtain reproducible results. This course requires a R version of 3.6 or newer to obtain the same results when setting the seed.
- To mimic the ultimate evaluation process, we randomly split our data into two — a training set and a test set — and act as if we don’t know the outcome of the test set. We develop algorithms using only the training set; the test set is used only for evaluation.
- The `'createDataPartition()'` function from the caret package can be used to generate indexes for randomly splitting data.
- Contrary to what the documentation says, this course will use the argument p as the percentage of data that goes to testing. The indexes made from createDataPartition() should be used to create the test set. Indexes should be created on the outcome and not a predictor.
- The simplest evaluation metric for categorical outcomes is overall accuracy: the proportion of cases that were correctly predicted in the test set.
